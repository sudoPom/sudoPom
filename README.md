- 👋 Hi, I’m @sudoPom, I'm a third year Comp-Sci undergrad at UCL.
- 👀 I’m interested in gaming, reading and of course programming.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to effectively use the Django library for python, however I'm looking into learning a few new languages such as rust and getting more familiar with JavaScript.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any fun open source projects.
- 📫 you can reach me on this email -> pponmilee@gmail.com
